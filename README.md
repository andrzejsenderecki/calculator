# calculator

This aplication is calculator which I wrote at Python. The aplication count basic mathematical operations such as:

- plus
- minus
- multiplication
- division
- percent
- square
- changing the positive number to negative or negative number to positive
- delete the result

The calculator always count last operation which you choose. For example:

Example 1
If you will choose number "10", next you will click "+", next you will choose number "5" and in the end you will click "-", the calculator will does plus, so your result will be equal "15". 

Example 2
If you will choose number "10", next you will click in sequence "+" "-" "*", next you will choose number "10" and in the end you will click "=", the calculator does operation multiplication, so your result will be equal "100".  

So this is simple aplication but it will does good operation even in such cases.
